/*
 For this project, you need to create two arguments: one for the dictionary, one for just the city name
 extract "day" from "temp", and "icon" from "weather", and they are both in the "list"
 
 In here, you are only taking care of the dictionary of info that represents the forecast.
 the code in the initWithDictionary can be done inside the loop that goes through the "list" in modelController
